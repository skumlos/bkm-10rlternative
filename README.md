BKM-10Rlternative, a plug-and-play replacement for the BKM-10R/11R (except for memory card, for now).

Still early, and there's a LOT of components, plus some tweaks might still be needed (button RC-filters).

Plans on memory stuff for firmware updates and such via SD cards, is planned, at least to be researched.
