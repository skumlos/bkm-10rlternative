BKM-10Rlternative, a plug-and-play replacement for the BKM-10R/11R (except for memory card, for now).

Still early, and there's a LOT of components, plus some tweaks might still be needed: 
* Button RC-filters, as I feel that the 10nF should be replaced with 100nF, but needs testing
* LED current limiting resistors is of course a preference. I used 470 Ohm in my first prototype.

Plans on memory card stuff for firmware updates and such via SD cards, is planned, at least to be researched.
